# Hare-and-Turtle-simulation-sfml
This is a graphical simulation of the famous race between [hare and  turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare).
<br>This program is written using the free [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/ "SFML") library.
<br>Install the additional [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/ "SFML") library in your project to run the simulation.
<br>
<br>Before the start of the race food is placed randomly.
<br>The tortoise and the hare begin a race at the same time. Every time a random movement is generated
(forward or backward) and the corresponding speed is set. When the turtle/hare eats an apple/carrot
it gets a bonus and increases its speed for a certain time(the default is 500 milliseconds).
<br>The winner is the one who first reaches the finish line.
